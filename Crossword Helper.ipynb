    "Starting with an 11x11 grid, I constructed the crossword below by repeatedly running `regex_word()` and filling lines in word by word. As I did this, I realized that there was a lot more I could do to automate the process. For example, I could pick matching words at random and have a program create the puzzle from scratch. However, it would probably be a good idea to give preference to more common words and words that are more likely to combine well with others given their location on the grid. So adding some awareness of useage and letter frequency could be useful. Anywho, this was all just a MacGuffin to show off regex. So given that, I'm rather happy with this as a result.\n",
